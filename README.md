# AI-Based Vector Database for Product Search & Recommendation

## 1. Introduction to Vector-Based Databases
A vector database stores and indexes high-dimensional vector embeddings, enabling fast similarity searches. Unlike traditional databases that rely on exact keyword matches, vector databases retrieve semantically similar results, making them ideal for applications like product recommendations, image searches, and natural language queries.

## 2. How Vector Databases Help LLMs
Large Language Models (LLMs) benefit from vector databases by efficiently retrieving relevant context and augmenting responses. By embedding textual data into vectors and using similarity searches, LLMs can generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses, making them ideal for question-answering and recommendation systems.

## 3. Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by retrieving external knowledge before generating responses. It combines a vector database with an LLM, ensuring answers are backed by factual data. This approach improves response accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and enables domain-specific applications like e-commerce search and customer support.

## 4. Creating Vector Embeddings
To generate vector embeddings for product descriptions, we use the `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model. Below is a natural language pseudocode for creating vector embeddings:

```
Load the sentence-transformers model 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'
For each product in the inventory:
    Convert the product title and description into a text string
    Pass the text string through the model to obtain a vector embedding
    Store the embedding in the vector database with product metadata
```

## 5. Basic Mathematics Behind Vector Search
Vector search works by computing similarity between query and stored embeddings. The most common method is cosine similarity:

```
Cosine Similarity(A, B) = (A · B) / (||A|| * ||B||)
```

Where:
- `A · B` is the dot product of two vectors
- `||A||` and `||B||` are their magnitudes

Higher cosine similarity values indicate greater relevance, enabling effective product recommendations.

## 6. Introduction to Faiss
Faiss (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is an efficient library for performing similarity searches in large-scale vector databases. It provides optimized indexing and retrieval algorithms, making it suitable for real-time search applications like e-commerce product recommendations.

## 7. Introduction to Groq
Groq is an AI inference engine optimized for LLMs, providing ultra-fast inference with minimal latency. Its high efficiency makes it suitable for deploying large-scale AI applications, including chat-based assistants that use vector databases for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

## 8. Creating an LLM Over Vector Search
To build an LLM-powered product search system using vector databases, follow this natural language pseudocode:

```
User inputs a query (e.g., "best budget smartphone")
Convert the query into a vector embedding using the same model
Search the vector database using cosine similarity to find the most relevant products
Retrieve the top-k matching product descriptions
Pass the retrieved product descriptions as context to the LLM (Groq-based model)
Generate a user-friendly response with product recommendations
Return the response to the user
```

This pipeline ensures accurate, context-aware product recommendations using a combination of vector search and LLM-based conversational AI.
